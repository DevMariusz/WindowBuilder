Currently a work in progress designed to assist in the data collection, design, fabrication and inventory of windows for residential  and commercial installations.

The design is subject to change.

Working as a single page application the current design is broken into 2 parts:
1. Input Forms
2. Output Tables

There are currently 3 distinct forms:
- Customer Details
- Window Specs
- Window Build

There are currently 4 seperate output tables:
- Customer Database
- Window Specs
- Window Build
- Shop List / Order Form
